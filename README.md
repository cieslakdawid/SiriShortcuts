# Siri Shortcuts 

### Scheduled content review
As I read interesting content (books, articles, posts, ...) that I think might be relevant in the future, I also try to summarise it in my notes. Although, just having notes might not enough to remember what's essential. Inspired by *Andy Matuschak's* and *Michael Nielsen's* [article](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) (`inspired` doesn't mean that it reflects what the article is about, I recommend reading anyway) for every summary I also want to schedule a reminder to revisit my notes (to make sure I remember it). I created a simple Siri Shortcut that:
1. Takes the summary/note's name (user's input) - I keep my notes in Notion with uniques names/ids
2. Adds multiple iOS reminders to revisit these notes in [5, 14, 30, 60] days from `now`. 

I keep my notes in `Notion` and ideally, I'd be integrated as part of this Siri Shortcut, although this application doesn't support such functionality yet.
